# RTL_mPCIE  
Mini-PCIe RTL-SDR  
This design is currently incomplete and somewhere around Altium 18 the pcb link for the PCIe connector got broken.
This is my attempt at making a half-lenght Mini-PCI Express card that has a fully featured RTL-SDR stick.  
PCB and SCH templates from [Altium Design Content](https://designcontent.live.altium.com/#TemplateDesignDetail/PDE-0001-00003) is used as the basis for this design.

As can be seen, there is still work to be done. 



<h3> RTL2832u and R820t components are from my own [Altium library](https://github.com/2ftg/ftg_lib)</h3>  
These components are based on reverse engineered work, as I don't have a datasheet for the RTL2832U.  
Thus potential errors are possible.  
As always there's no guarantee of anything.
