Mini-PCIe RTL-SDR\s\s
This is my attempt at making a half-lenght Mini-PCI-Express card that has a fully featured RTL-SDR stick.\s\s
PCB and SCH templates from ALtium design content is used as the basis for this design.\s\s

<h1> RTL2832u and R820t components are from my own Altium library </h1>

<h4>Music that consumed during design</h4>
